    <h1>Thai Chicken Coconut Curry</h1>
    <img src = "curry.webp" alt = "pic of curry">
    <h3>This is an easy Thai chicken curry that’s 
        made in one skillet and ready in 20 minutes! 
        With cold weather upon us, nothing is better than diving into a bowl 
        of this hearty yet healthy comfort food that’s layered with flavors. 
        I could just drink the coconut milk-based sauce. Thai red curry is savory, 
        salty, there’s natural sweetness from the sweet Vidalia onions, carrots, and coconut milk. There’s perfect acid balance from lime juice and a very gentle heat from the Thai red curry paste.
